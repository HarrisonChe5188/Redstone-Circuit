# Redstone-Circuit
A passion project of bringing a Minecraft redstone circuit to life for Boston University's Lutron Lighting Innovation Competition.

🛠 Project Overview

This project brings Minecraft redstone circuits to life using an Arduino, basic electronics, and snap-on wire connectors to create a modular system. The components replicate Minecraft mechanics, including:

Redstone Torch 🔥

Redstone Lamp 💡

Lever ⚡

Piston (with Arduino-controlled Servo) 🏗

Wooden Slab 🪵

Each component connects using modular snap-on wire connectors, allowing easy assembly and reconfiguration—just like placing blocks in Minecraft!

⚙️ How It Works

The lever toggles the circuit on and off.

The redstone torch provides continuous power when placed.

The redstone lamp lights up when powered.

The piston is controlled via an Arduino and servo motor, moving when the circuit is powered.

Snap-on wire connectors allow modular and easy circuit assembly.

🏗 Hardware & Materials

Arduino (Uno/Nano/etc.)

Servo Motor (for piston movement)

LEDs (for redstone torch & lamp)

Resistors

Push Button / Toggle Switch (for lever)

Wood/Plastic pieces (for modular design)

Snap-on wire connectors

Jumper Wires & Soldering Kit

🖥 Code & Circuit Setup

Upload the provided Arduino sketch to control the piston.

Connect the components according to the circuit diagram (see below).

Use snap-on connectors to assemble and test different redstone circuits!

🚀 Future Improvements

Add more redstone components (e.g., repeaters, comparators)

Improve modularity with 3D-printed casings

Integrate with a larger Minecraft-inspired automation system

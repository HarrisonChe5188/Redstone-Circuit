# Redstone-Circuit
A passion project of bringing a Minecraft redstone circuit to life for Boston University's Lutron Lighting Innovation Competition. We also won first place!

Project Overview

This project brings Minecraft redstone circuits to life using an Arduino, basic electronics, and snap-on wire connectors to create a modular system. The components replicate Minecraft mechanics, including:

Redstone Torch 🔥
Redstone Lamp 💡
Lever ⚡
Piston (with Arduino-controlled Servo) 🏗
Wooden Slab 🪵

Each component connects using modular snap-on wire connectors, allowing easy assembly and reconfiguration—just like placing blocks in Minecraft!
